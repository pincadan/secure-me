Here is a Python script that demonstrates a basic implementation of the SecureMe app.

This script provides a basic implementation of the SecureMe app. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1.The generate_salt() function generates a random salt using the os.urandom() function.

2.The derive_key() function derives a key from a password and salt using the PBKDF2 key derivation function with SHA-256.

3.The encrypt_password() and decrypt_password() functions encrypt and decrypt passwords using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm.

4.The generate_password() function generates a strong, random password of a specified length.

5.The store_passwords() and load_passwords() functions handle storing and loading encrypted passwords from a JSON file.

6.The add_password() function adds a new password to the JSON file. It generates a salt, derives a key, encrypts the generated password, and stores it along with the salt.

7.The get_password() function retrieves a password from the JSON file. It retrieves the salt and encrypted password, derives the key, and decrypts the password.

8.The main() function serves as the entry point of the app. It loads the encrypted passwords, prompts the user for authentication, and provides options to add new passwords or retrieve existing ones.

Note: This script is a basic implementation and does not include features like secure storage of the master password or handling of multiple users. 
It also lacks user-friendly error messages and input validation. 
In a production-ready app, you would need to add more robust error handling, user interface, and security features.
